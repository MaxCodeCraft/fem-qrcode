## Overview

I learned theory via freeCodeCamp, CodeCademy and some YouTube videos. I arrived at a point where I tought I konw quite a bit about HTML and CSS but when I tried to make a web page on my own it didn't goes well !
So I've done some YouTube research again to build a website from scratch and I've landed on Coder Coder YT chanel that made me discover Frontend Mentor. I think that it is exactly what I need right know to practice what I've learned. 

So here is my first submission, let me know what you think about my code ! Thank you !
